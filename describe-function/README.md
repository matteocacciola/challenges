# Describe Function
You have to create a function calcType, which receives 3 arguments: 2 numbers, and the result of an unknown operation performed on them (also a number).
Based on those 3 values you have to return a string, that describes which operation was used to get the given result.
The possible return strings are: "+", "-", "*", "/".
In case of division you should expect that the result of the operation is obtained by using / operator on the input values.

Here, I propose a solution in Typescript.
