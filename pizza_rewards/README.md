# Loneliest number
Implementation in Typescript of the so-called Loneliest number problem.
The range of vision of a digit is equal to its own value. 1 can see one digit to the left and one digit to the right, 2 can see two digits, and so on.
Thus, the loneliness of a digit is the sum of the digits which it can see.
Given a non-negative integer, your function must determine the loneliest number in the string.
