# HackerRank Arrays

This is the collection of my solutions to the problems proposed by HackerRank in the section [Arrays](https://www.hackerrank.com/interview/interview-preparation-kit/arrays/challenges).

## 2D Array - DS
Given a 6x6 2D Array, `arr`

```
1 1 1 0 0 0
0 1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
```

An hourglass in `A` is a subset of values with indices falling in this pattern in `arr`'s graphical representation:

```
a b c
  d
e f g
```

There are 16 hourglasses in `arr`. An hourglass sum is the sum of an hourglass' values. Calculate the hourglass sum for
every hourglass in `Ã¦rr`, then print the maximum hourglass sum. The array will always be 6x6.

## Arrays: Left Rotation
A left rotation operation on an array shifts each of the array's elements unit to the left. For example,
if left rotations are performed on array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, then the array would become `[3, 4, 5, 1, 2]`. Note that the
lowest index item moves to the highest index in a rotation. This is called a circular array.

Given an array `a` of `n` integers and a number, `d`, perform left rotations on the array. Return the updated array to be
printed as a single line of space-separated integers.

## New Year Chaos
It is New Year's Day and people are in line for the Wonderland rollercoaster ride. Each person wears a sticker indicating
their initial position in the queue from `1` to `n`. Any person can bribe the person directly in front of them to swap
positions, but they still wear their original sticker. One person can bribe at most two others.

Determine the minimum number of bribes that took place to get to a given queue order. Print the number of bribes, or,
if anyone has bribed more than two people, print `Too chaotic`.

## Minimum Swaps 2
You are given an unordered array consisting of consecutive integers `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]` without any duplicates.
You are allowed to swap any two elements. Find the minimum number of swaps required to sort the array in ascending order.

## Array Manipulation
Starting with a 1-indexed array of zeros and a list of operations, for each operation add a value to each the array
element between two given indices, inclusive. Once all operations have been performed, return the maximum value in the array.
